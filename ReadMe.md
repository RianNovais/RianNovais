# ðŸ‘‰ About Me:
Hi! I'm Rian, I'm 21 years old and I'm currently studying Software Engineering. I'm a computer technician and passionate about coding.

I work as an RPA developer with a focus on Python and, at the moment, I'm delving deeper into Java/Spring Boot to expand my skills and professional opportunities.
